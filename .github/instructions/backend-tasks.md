# 🎯 Fully Managed Trade Copier Website — Production-Ready Specification

I’m building a **fully managed trade copier website**. Users should only interact with the website to register accounts, configure copier settings, and monitor performance. They must **not** have to install or manage their own EAs — everything must be handled by the backend infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Core Requirements

* **Trade replication latency:** Must happen in milliseconds (<50ms target).
* **User experience:** Entirely web-based (account setup, master/slave config, monitoring).
* **Backend stack:** Next.js + Supabase (expandable if needed).
* **Cost efficiency:** Prefer free/in-house solutions (no reliance on third-party paid APIs).
* **Scalability:** Architecture must scale easily from dozens to thousands of users.
* **Reliability:** Must provide 99.9% uptime, robust error handling, and fault tolerance.
* **Security:** Account credentials must be encrypted and stored securely.

## 🏗️ Recommended Architecture: Centralized VPS Farm

Your infrastructure manages all MT4/MT5 connectivity, trade monitoring, and execution. Users only interact with the web platform.

```

## 📋 User Flow

1. **Account Registration**

   * User signs up on the website
   * Enters MT4/MT5 credentials (login, password, server)
   * Chooses master or slave role and defines mappings

2. **Automatic Deployment**

   * Credentials validated and stored securely
   * Accounts assigned to VPS containers
   * System auto-connects to broker and starts monitoring

3. **Trade Copying**

   * Master trades detected in real time
   * Copy rules applied automatically
   * Slave accounts execute trades instantly
   * Website shows real-time status and logs

## 🛠️ Technical Components

* **VPS Infrastructure**

  * Dockerized MT4/MT5 with EAs
  * Load balancing + auto-scaling (Kubernetes at scale)
  * Broker separation (demo/live)
* **Connection Manager**

  * Secure credential storage
  * Automatic logins + retries
  * Health checks and reconnection
* **Trade Detection Engine**

  * Event-driven architecture
  * Deduplication and normalization
  * Real-time broadcasting
* **Copy Execution Engine**

  * Applies copy mappings and lot sizing
  * Ensures atomic trade operations
  * Tracks execution status and errors
* **Monitoring & Analytics**

  * Real-time dashboards
  * Alerts and system health monitoring
  * Usage analytics for scaling and billing

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

* Phase 1: Single VPS (50–100 accounts)
* Phase 2: VPS cluster with load balancing (1k–10k users)
* Phase 3: Multi-region distributed system (10k+ users)

Performance targets:

* **Trade detection latency:** 1–2ms
* **Execution latency:** 10–50ms
* **Capacity:** \~100 accounts per VPS

## 💰 Cost & Monetization

* VPS cost: \~\$50–100/month per 100 accounts
* Revenue model: subscription tiers, optional per-trade fees, premium features

## 🚀 Deployment Phases

1. **MVP (Month 1–2):** Single VPS, manual deployment, 10–50 beta users
2. **Automation (Month 3–4):** Automated deployment, monitoring, 100–500 users
3. **Scale (Month 5–6):** Multi-VPS, auto-scaling, multi-region, 1k+ users

## ⚡ Key Advantages

* **For users:** Zero setup, instant activation, reliable copying
* **For operator:** Centralized control, predictable scaling, monetizable at low cost

**Question:** How should I implement this centralized architecture so that it achieves millisecond-level trade replication, strong reliability, and smooth scaling — all without requiring users to run their own EAs?
